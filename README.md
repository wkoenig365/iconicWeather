## ***THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION PURPOSES***

This repo acts as a place for me to play around with the Ionic framework for mobile devices (Android specifically).
The app will ***regularly be broken*** since I'm only working on it in my free time just to get more experience with the framework.

At this moment in time, I have no intentions of finishing the application since I currently prefer Java Android development over this.
